## 	:pushpin: The problem
Supply chains are a mess and customers are angry.

 When it comes to data about their products, people have been relying on what they are told, with no means to cross-check it. The entire quality of the supply chain relies on government-based authority. There is no transparency in the supply chain. Counterfeit products and black marketing run rampant and supply chain malpractices, when discovered cause not only the customers, but also the company huge losses, both in terms of revenue and public trust in them. 
 
 India loses nearly $65 billion every year due to inefficient supply chains. Through decentralization of the entire process, demand forecasting as well as enabling efficient communication, this project aims to change that.

## 	:heavy_check_mark: The solution

We have built a blockchain-based website for supply chain monitoring. The application has three portals: for manufacturers/farmers, warehouses, and end-users. 

1. Manufacturers can register their products by adding them to the blockchain.
2. When it reaches the warehouse, it can scan the shipment.  
3. Finally, the end-users can trace the history of their products, right from the manufacturer to them.

The <b>immutability of blockchain</b> creates additional trust, transparency and security.

The project is divided into two parts: the client side built using React JS and the server side, built with Node JS, Express and Firebase.

### The client
To run locally, make sure you have npm, ganache and truffle installed. Also, get Metamask browser extension to make the browser interact with the blockchain.

1. Move to server directory and run

    ```npm install```
2. Make sure you have ganache-cli installed, and after that run 


   ```ganache cli```
3. In a seprate terminal, complie and migrate the blockchian code.


   ```truffle compile```
   
   ```truffle migrate```
   
   
4. After this, start the server by running


   ```npm start```

### The server
Similarly for server, follow the given steps in a sepesrate termianl:

1. Move to server directory and run


   ```npm install```
2. Start the server by running:


   ```npm start```
